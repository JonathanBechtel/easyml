Handcoded Machine Learning Algorithms in Numpy

# Purpose
This repository is meant to be a resource for people who'd like to easily study the core algorithmic logic of various machine learning techniques.  Every algorithm is written in basic numpy with nothing else added to distract from the basics of how a machine learning technique arrives at its answer.  The algorithms work, so it could be used for production purposes, but there's no reason it'd give you better results than all of the other libraries available that are almost surely better optimized for performance.  It also hasn't been written with that use in mind, so it'd likely have a lot of rough edges if you were fitting on real world datasets.  

Most algorithms were verified for accuracy with toy datasets, so there are no guarantees you'd get workable performance on something that was industrial scale.

# Installation
* Go to the repository you'd want to use the program in
* git clone https://github.com/JonathanBechtel/easyml.git
* You'll probably have to play around with some path directories to get things working, but that's a start
